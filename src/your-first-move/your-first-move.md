# Your first Move

In this section you'll get to experience the Move language first-hand. You'll learn how to create a package, write a simple module, test it, generate documentation and publish it on-chain. While the guide is not complete on the last part (as every network has specifics on how to publish a package), it will give you a good idea of how to work with Move.

This guide will reference topics which you will learn later in this book. If you are not familiar with some of the concepts, don't worry, you'll learn them later. Try to focus on the task at hand and don't get distracted by the details.

> It is important that you have a working Move environment. If you haven't set it up yet, please refer to the [Install Sui](../install-sui.md) section. 

This section is divided into the following parts (in order):

- [Hello World](hello-world.md)
- [Adding Tests](adding-tests.md)
- [Debugging](debugging.md)
- [Generating Docs](generating-docs.md)
- [Publish a package](./publish-a-package.md)
