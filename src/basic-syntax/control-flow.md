# Control Flow

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce control flow statements.
Notes:
    - if/else is an expression
    - while () {} loop
    - continue and break
    - loop {}
    - infinite loop is possible but will lead to gas exhaustion
    - return keyword
    - if is an expression and as such requires a semicolon (!!!)
