# Assert and Abort

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce abort keyword and `assert!` macro.
Notes:
    - previous chapter mentions constants
    - error constants standard ECamelCase
    - `assert!` macro
    - asserts should go before the main logic
    - Move has no catch mechanism
    - abort codes are local to the module
    - there are no error messages emitted
    - error codes should handle all possible scenarios in this module
