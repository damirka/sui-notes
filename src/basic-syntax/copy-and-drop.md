# Copy and Drop

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Introduce Copy and Drop abilities of Move.
Notes:
    - compare them to primitive types introduces before;
    - what is an ability without drop
    - drop is not necessary for unpacking
    - make a joke about a bacteria pattern in the code
    - mention that a struct with only `drop` ability is called a Witness
    - mention that a struct without abilities is called a Hot Potato
    - mention that there are two more abilities which are covered in a later chapter

    - language reference (abilities)
    - authorization patterns (or witness)
    - hot potato pattern
    - key and store abilities (later chapter)
