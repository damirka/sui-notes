# References

<!--

Chapter: Basic Syntax
Goal: Show what the borrow checker is and how it works.
Notes:
    - give the metro pass example
    - show why passing by reference is useful
    - mention that reference comparison is faster
    - references can be both mutable and immutable
    - immutable access to shared objects is faster
    - implicit copy
    - moving the value
    - unpacking a reference (mutable and immutable)
